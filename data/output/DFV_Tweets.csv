2020-10-31 15:43:12,"@IntrinsicInv 9/n Then we return to $GME's legacy business, which is likely to thrive in coming yrs. Dramatic cost-cutting, a massively revamped omnichannel experience (see $BBY for proof B&amp;M can work), &amp; fact that gamers prefer physical over digital in early yrs of cycle is recipe for success"
2020-10-31 15:42:49,@IntrinsicInv 8/n On the merchandising front $GME is now more aggressively pursuing PC gaming &amp; accessories. This is a major opportunity because these are higher margin products and $GME is poised to participate meaningfully in this space given its scale and complementary offerings

2020-10-31 15:41:06,"@IntrinsicInv 6/n Seems likely that we’ll soon hear from $GME about similar partnerships with firms like $SNE, $NTDOY, $ATVI, $EA, etc. Ex via Preston: Game publishers spend up to $300m marketing blockbuster games; could make sense to partner w/ $GME to showcase games or try out new concepts"

2020-10-31 15:40:20,@IntrinsicInv 4/n $GME already participates in the new digital landscape; see the recent long-term digital revenue-sharing partnership w/ $MSFT whereby they benefit from all downstream DLC on both new and pre-owned consoles they sell https://t.co/nPA45eeB6W

2020-09-01 14:54:49,When the level of $GME short interest is juxtaposed with my level of bullishness (&amp; presumably that of Cohen &amp; Burry) I can't help but think it's a result of automated shorting algorithms gone awry.

2020-08-30 16:14:00,11/ It’s impossible not to think of $GME when you read and listen to how Cohen succeeded with $CHWY. Replace “pet” with “gaming” and it’s the exact same strategy. It’s absurd.
2020-08-30 16:14:00,"10c/ $GME Right now [Cohen] is trying to figure out what the next “something” will be for him. ""I look at almost everything that comes to me, but I say no to 99.9% of it.""

2020-08-30 16:13:57,3/ This makes sense considering his playbook for $CHWY (provide amazing customer experiences as category experts) is exactly what $GME is shooting for.
2020-08-30 16:13:56,2/ Read the interviews with him – a relatively small $30 million purchase of a speculative stock isn’t his style. He’s likely making a big long-term move into the gaming industry via $GME.
2020-08-30 16:13:56,1/ As a multi-billionaire Ryan Cohen of $CHWY will likely buy more $GME in the coming weeks/months. It appears once he made his decision he quickly bought up as much as he could in August before he had to file the 13D.

2020-08-29 12:06:09,2/4 $CHWY Cohen is a visionary who went up against Amazon and won. He brings tremendous e-commerce &amp; omnichannel experience to $GME and understands the importance of delighting customers and creating amazing in-store experiences.
2020-08-29 12:06:08,1/4 $CHWY Ryan Cohen's 9% 13D stake in $GME is huge news. The company trades at such a deep discount and is so heavily shorted that a minor shift in investors' long-term perception of its future could have a dramatic impact on price.
